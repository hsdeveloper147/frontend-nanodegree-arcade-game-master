## About the game
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. 	   Once the player reaches the water the score is incremented.
Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square and score is reset to zero.
